    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p class="TextMid">My name is Jayden Mosley. I am an aspiring JavaScript and Web beginner developer.</p>

    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="TextMid">I began programming to bring my ideas and creations to life. I’ve been working with JavaScript for 5 years. After graduating high school on May 20th, 2025, I started focusing on learning web dev.  
    Outside of dev work, I enjoy gaming, chatting with friends, writing, and more. My favorite color is any shade of blue — especially the darker ones. I was homeschooled through grades 7th to 12th.</p>
    <img class="imgMid" src="grad me.png" alt="Graduation" width="200">
    <p class="TextMid"> I also have a dog! His name is Major and he is definitely my best friend. I love him with all my heart, almost as if he's been with me all my life.</p>
    <img class="imgMid" src="Major puppy.png" alt="Major!" width="200">
    <h1>Goals</h1>
    <p class="TextMid">My goals in the future are to build a successful freelancing life and become my own boss. My experience being homeschooled and learning on my own makes me pretty adamant that I am capable of accomplishing this.
        I aim to be good at multiple things outside of just programming and web development.</p>

    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p class="TextMid">A few projects I’ve made or am working on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="ulMid">This portfolio (yep, what you're reading now).</li>
        <li class="ulMid">A simple calculator using JavaScript.</li>
        <li class="ulMid">A number guessing game with difficulty and branching outcomes.</li>
        <li class="ulMid">A mock site about my favorite Pokémon, to practice web dev.</li>
    </ul>
